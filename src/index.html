<!-- SPA
Single Page Application

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server. 
This approach allows for a more fluid user experience, similar to a desktop application. 
SPAs typically use AJAX requests to fetch data from the server and update the UI without requiring a full page reload. -->
